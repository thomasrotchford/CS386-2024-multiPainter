# MultiPixel

"MultiPixel is an online relaxation video game designed to offer a more enjoyable experience for stressed individuals during their leisure time. Our program is unique as it offers free, easy access to pixel painting software, which can be interacted with anytime, simply through a web browser, helping solve the problem above. Additionally, it fosters a sense of community through a workshop feature where users can showcase their creations, allowing others to download and enjoy coloring their artwork."

## Deployment

Our Program is already deployed on a live system, here are the steps we followed to do so

We used AWS Amplify as the hosting option it directly connects to our GitHub where it will pull the files react we wish to host, all we have to alter the build script to open the right files.
